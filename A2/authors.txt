Notes About program:
First Run: "sh build.sh" to compile the java program
Next Run: "sh run.sh <machine code file to use>" to run the program on the given file

Output is 100% complete and will run in the emulator

Note! - The only gripe with this program is with immediate values. The machine code can only handle immediate values in the range -2047 to 2047 per the 12-bit signed ALU_immediate of the I-instruction format.
